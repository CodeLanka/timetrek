          <h2>The Kingdom of Kotte, centered on Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, was a kingdom that flourished in Sri Lanka during the 15th century</h2>
          <p class="mt">After King Parakuramabahu the 6th, ascended the throne in 1415, he moved the capitol to Kotte.<br/>
            He then ordered the prince "Sapumal" to go and conquer the nothern part of the country from "Araya Chakrawarthi" and take Jaffna into control.
      Prince "Ambulugala" was sent to the up country to counter "Jothiya" who ruled the up country at that time.
            The subsequent period is considered as a politically stable time period in Sri Lankan history.
            After king Parakramabahu VI's death, his grandson king "Jayabahu II"(1468 - 1472) inherited the throne.
      Prince Sapumal grabbed the throne by killing king "Jayabahu II" under the name "Buwanekabahu" the 6th(1472 - 1480). The next king was his son king "Parakramabahu VII"(1480 - 1484).
